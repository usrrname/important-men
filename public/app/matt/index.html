                        Matthew might look like he's scowling but he's actually feeling alright. He has thirty-two years of experience living as
                        a cis male man. He once impulse bought an $800 leather jacket and recently tried wearing dresses. In a former life he had
                        an immaculate collection of vintage boutique clothing, which he narrowed down to a set of outfits he could wear&nbsp;routinely.
                        <br>
                        <br> Matthew sometimes forgets to eat, but when he does he picks something delectable. He has made a lot of money and very little
                        money, and takes pleasure in decorating and cleaning his tiny&nbsp;apartment.
                        <br>
                        <br> Matthew finds it hard to connect with men due to his disdain for sports and boasting, but has tried using Bumble to find
                        guy friends. He has always been feminine. He likes to blow bubbles in milkshakes and bob up and down when he finds a bouncy seat at the&nbsp;bar.
                        <br>
                        <br> On Saturday afternoon you may find Matthew bursting into laughter while reading bodybuilder forums or driving around Los Angeles while listening to Bobby
                        Brown. Matt has a penchant for discussing relationship problems. He has a delightfully high pitched giggle and sweeps his
                        hair back in a demure way when he's talking. He can see the good in the bad and the bad in the good, and will always offer
                        his most honest, blunt&nbsp;opinion.
